        $ cd 0-Install-private-registry/
        $ bash install.sh
    (**) Note: when command line want from you to complete the certificate info please on FQDN enter you {domain} name that you want to publish the docker registry
        (e.g: registry.hacktor.com)
    2- pull one simple container from docker hub and push it on your own docker registry
        $ docker pull hello-world
        $ docker tag  hello-world:latest localhost:5000/my-hello-world
        $ docker push localhost:5000/my-hello-world
